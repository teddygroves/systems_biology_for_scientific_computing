# Introduction
## Recap

Last time we learned about quantitative omics data.

* Things we can measure: sequences, transcripts, metabolites, proteins, fluxes
* Technologies: LCMS and isotope labelling
* Statistical features: compositionality, sequentiality, structural knowledge

## Plan for today
Build a very simple Bayesian whole body kinetic model.
